We're going to use a super simple and flexible grid system. With this system we can directly specify the element size by calling the mixin or create classes that are using the mixin to define bootstrap-like cols classes.
To keep it simple and small, we're trying to get rid of these pain in the ass row/cols layout while using only a col layout.


Usage :
To create a simple column just call @include col(1,3) which will create a 1/3 (33,3333333...%) wide col.
The you have options such as gap width, vertical align and first and last element of the col which removes left or right padding.
For this last option, we could have used first-child but last-child was implemented only in css3 which is a big no no in our project.
